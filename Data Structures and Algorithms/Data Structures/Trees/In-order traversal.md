In-order traversal is a method of visiting nodes in a binary tree by following the pattern: left subtree, root node, right subtree. This traversal method visits nodes in ascending order when applied to a binary search tree.

## Implementation

The algorithm follows these steps for each node:
1. Recursively traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the current node
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree

Here's a simple implementation in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def inorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        # Traverse left subtree
        inorder_traversal(root.left)
        # Visit current node
        print(root.value, end=' ')
        # Traverse right subtree
        inorder_traversal(root.right)
```

## Iterative Approach

The traversal can also be implemented iteratively using a stack:

```python
def inorder_iterative(root):
    stack = []
    current = root
    
    while current or stack:
        # Reach the leftmost node
        while current:
            stack.append(current)
            current = current.left
            
        current = stack.pop()
        print(current.value, end=' ')
        current = current.right
```

## Applications

In-order traversal is particularly useful for:
- Obtaining sorted elements from a binary search tree
- Expression tree evaluation where operators follow infix notation
- Creating a binary tree copy
- Comparing two binary trees for structural equivalence
