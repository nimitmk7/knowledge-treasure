Pre-order traversal is a tree traversal method that visits the root node first, then traverses the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. This "root-first" approach is particularly useful for creating a copy of the tree or generating a prefix expression from an expression tree.

## Implementation

The algorithm follows these steps for each node:
1. Visit the current node
2. Recursively traverse the left subtree
3. Recursively traverse the right subtree

Here's a recursive implementation in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def preorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        # Visit current node
        print(root.value, end=' ')
        # Traverse left subtree
        preorder_traversal(root.left)
        # Traverse right subtree
        preorder_traversal(root.right)
```

## Iterative Approach

The traversal can also be implemented using a stack:

```python
def preorder_iterative(root):
    if not root:
        return
        
    stack = [root]
    
    while stack:
        current = stack.pop()
        print(current.value, end=' ')
        
        # Push right child first (so left is processed first)
        if current.right:
            stack.append(current.right)
        if current.left:
            stack.append(current.left)
```

## Applications

Pre-order traversal is commonly used for:
- Creating a copy of the binary tree
- Serializing or deserializing a tree structure
- Converting an expression tree to prefix notation
- Building a prefix expression from an expression tree
