It is a system made up of Multiple Components on Multiple Machines but for a user it is a single coherent system which solves a bigger problem.

Why do we need a distributed System ?
1. Scale
2. Horizontal Scalability
3. Fault Tolerance

# Tips for designing/building

1. The best and worst thing about the distributed system is Murphy’s Law: *“Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”*
	1. Assuming that after every single line of code, your machine is failing. More pessimistic outlook towards a Distributed System, the better system you will built. 

2. Start with a Day 0 architecture and scale each component.
	1. See how it performs under load
	2. Rectify the System
	3. Re-architect
	4. Repeat
