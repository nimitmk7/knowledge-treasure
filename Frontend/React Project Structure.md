# Folder Structure

## Node Modules
 The `node_modules` folder is a fundamental part of React projects, serving as the local storage for all third-party dependencies installed via npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn.

- **Recreatable**: Entirely regenerated via `npm install` using `package.json`/`package-lock.json.
- **Hierarchical Structure**:
```text
node_modules/
├── express/       # Direct dependency
│   └── node_modules/
│       └── body-parser/  # Nested dependency
└── lodash/
```

## Public
The `public` directory in React serves as a storage location for static assets that don't require processing through Webpack. Here's a detailed breakdown of its purpose and usage:

## Core Functions

1. **Static Asset Storage**
    - Houses files that must be directly accessible without compilation:
        
    - Assets like images/fonts can also reside here if they don't need optimization
2. **Direct Copy Mechanism**
    
    - Files are copied verbatim to the `build/` folder during `npm run build
    - No Webpack processing means:
        - No minification/hashing
        - No dependency graph checks[3](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/assets-and-create-react-app-whats-the-right-way-to-handle-them-a145587bd506?gi=437500e88376)[4](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-the-public-folder/)
    
3. **Accessibility via `PUBLIC_URL`**
    
    - Reference files using:jsx
        
        `// HTML <link href="%PUBLIC_URL%/style.css" /> // JSX <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/logo.png'} />`
        
    - Resolves correctly in both development and production builds

## Src
The `src` directory (short for "source") is the central hub for all React application code and assets that require processing through the build system. Here's a detailed breakdown of its role and contents:

## Core Purpose

- **Webpack Processing**: All files in `src` get optimized during builds (minified, bundled, tree-shaken)
- **Component Development**: Houses React components, hooks, and application logic
- **Modern JS Support**: Enables ES6+ features and JSX compilation via Babel
- **Dependency Management**: Imports resolve through Webpack's module system
