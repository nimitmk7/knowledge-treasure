Go is a procedural-compiled programming language, rather than a traditional object-oriented programming language. 

While Go doesn't have classes, it allows developers to structure their code around data and behavior using other constructs:

 - **[[Structs]]**: These allow you to group related data together, similar to how properties are defined in a class.
 - **[[Interfaces]]**: Go's interface system allows you to define behavior without specifying the exact implementation, providing powerful abstraction and polymorphism
 - **[[Functions]]**: Functions in Go can be associated with structs, acting as methods that operate on the struct's data.
 - [[Methods]]

The language's design emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency through features like **[[GoRoutines]]** and [[Channels]], rather than a class-based OOP model.
