In Go, interfaces are a powerful concept that ==allows you to define behavior without specifying the exact implementation==. This is a key feature of Go's type system, especially important because the language does not support classes in the traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) sense.

Here's what interfaces entail in Go:
- **Defining Behavior**: An interface in Go is a collection of method signatures. It specifies what a type can do, not how it does it.
- **Implicit Implementation**: A type is said to "implement" an interface if it provides definitions for all the methods declared in that interface. ==There is no explicit keyword like implements as seen in other languages==; the implementation is implicit and determined by the compiler. This simplicity makes Go's interface system highly flexible and easy to use

Interfaces are fundamental for achieving **polymorphism and abstraction** in Go. You can write functions that accept an interface type, meaning they can operate on any concrete type that implements that interface, promoting code reuse and flexible design.


```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

type geometry interface {
    area() float64
    perim() float64
}

type rect struct {
    width, height float64
}
type circle struct {
    radius float64
}

func (r rect) area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}
func (r rect) perim() float64 {
    return 2*r.width + 2*r.height
}

func (c circle) area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}
func (c circle) perim() float64 {
    return 2 * math.Pi * c.radius
}

func measure(g geometry) {
    fmt.Println(g)
    fmt.Println(g.area())
    fmt.Println(g.perim())
}

func detectCircle(g geometry) {
    if c, ok := g.(circle); ok {
        fmt.Println("circle with radius", c.radius)
    }
}

func main() {
    r := rect{width: 3, height: 4}
    c := circle{radius: 5}

    measure(r)
    measure(c)

    detectCircle(r)
    detectCircle(c)
}
```

```console
$ go run interfaces.go
{3 4}

{5}
78.53981633974483
