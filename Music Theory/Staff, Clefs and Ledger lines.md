# Staff
- The staff is the foundation upon which notes are drawn.
- The modern staff comprises five lines and four spaces.
- Every line or space on the staff represents a white key on the keyboard

# Clefs
- Clefs assign individual notes to certain lines or spaces.
- Two clefs are normally used:
	- Treble
	- Bass

## Treble Clefs
- The staff line which the clef wraps around(shown in red) is known as G. Any note placed on this line becomes G. 
- The note on the space above G is A.
- The note on the line above A is B.
- This process continues

- We just ran out of room to place notes, what happens now ?
	- We use Ledger lines.
## Bass Clef
The staff line in between the two dots of the clef is F. We can now fill the rest of the staff with notes.

# Ledger Lines

A ledger line is a small line that extends the staff when we run out of room. WIth the ledger line drawn, we can place the A.

# Grand Staff
- Finally, we will discuss the **Grand Staff**, a theoretical staff consisting of eleven lines.
- Watch what happens when we eliminate the middle line – we end up with two regular staffs.
- By adding a Treble Clef to the top staff and a Bass Clef to the bottom staff, we can see the relationship between the two staffs.
- Notice how the two clefs are “joined” by the C (shown in red).
- **This C is commonly called “middle C” since it corresponds to the middle staff line on the Grand Staff.**
