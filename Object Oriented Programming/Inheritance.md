Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. 

The new class, called the **subclass**, inherits all the fields and methods of the existing class, called the **superclass**. This means that you can reuse the code that you have already written in the superclass in the subclass.

## Advantages
There are two main benefits to using inheritance:
1. **Code reuse**: Inheritance allows you to reuse code that you have already written. This can save you time and effort, and it can also help to make your code more consistent.
2. **Extensibility**: Inheritance allows you to extend the functionality of an existing class. This can be useful for creating new classes that are tailored to specific needs.

## Example

-  Superclass
```Java
public class Bicycle {
        
    // **the Bicycle class has three _fields_**
    public int cadence;
    public int gear;
    public int speed;
        
    // **the Bicycle class has one _constructor_**
    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {
        gear = startGear;
        cadence = startCadence;
        speed = startSpeed;
    }
        
    // **the Bicycle class has four _methods_**
    public void setCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
    }
        
    public void setGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
    }
        
    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
        speed -= decrement;
    }
        
    public void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed += increment;
    }
        
}

```

- Subclass

``` Java
public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {
        
    // **the MountainBike subclass adds one _field_**
    public int seatHeight;

    // **the MountainBike subclass has one _constructor_**
    public MountainBike(int startHeight,
                        int startCadence,
                        int startSpeed,
                        int startGear) {
        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);
        seatHeight = startHeight;
    }   
        
    // **the MountainBike subclass adds one _method_**
    public void setHeight(int newValue) {
        seatHeight = newValue;
    }   
}
```
