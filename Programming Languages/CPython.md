CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language, written in C. It is the most widely used Python runtime and plays a crucial role in executing Python code. Here's an overview of what CPython does:

### **Key Functions of CPython**
1. **Parsing and Compilation**:
   - When you write Python code, CPython first parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   - It then compiles the AST into **bytecode**, which is an intermediate, platform-independent representation of your code[1][5].

2. **Bytecode Interpretation**:
   - The generated bytecode is executed by CPython's **bytecode interpreter**, which evaluates the instructions in a loop. This process allows your Python code to run without being directly converted to machine code[5][6].

3. **Runtime Environment**:
   - CPython provides a runtime environment that includes memory management, garbage collection, built-in types, and modules. It initializes necessary data structures and manages the execution state through interpreters and threads[2][5].

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors are detected during execution rather than before runtime because CPython processes Python code line by line[1].

5. **Standard Library and Extensions**:
   - CPython includes the Python standard library and supports extensions written in C for performance-critical tasks[4].

### **How CPython Differs from Other Implementations**
- CPython compiles Python code into its own bytecode and interprets it, while other implementations like PyPy or Jython may use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation or target different platforms (e.g., JVM for Jython)[6].
- It is considered the "official" implementation of Python and serves as the basis for new language features[6].

In summary, CPython acts as both a compiler (to bytecode) and an interpreter (of bytecode), providing a complete runtime environment for executing Python programs.
