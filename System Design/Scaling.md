It is the ability to handle large number of concurrent requests.

## Scaling Database

### Read Replicas
Non-critical read requests go to read replicas. 
Critical reads and writes go to master.

#### When should you use read replicas ?
1. We are okay with serving stale data. 
2. Read:Write request ratio is very large.
### Sharding
Split your data into mutually exclusive subsets and have multiple different servers handle different subsets. Each of those servers can have their own read replicas if needed. 

API server has connections all the DB servers and their replicas. 

### Proxy SQL
Add a proxy server ==that is aware of Topology and takes care of routing==.

**Con**: Extra network hop to Proxy server.
